Redesign admin/dashboard.php into a modern interactive analytics dashboard:
1. Keep all backend PHP logic.
2. Replace table layout with card-based stats and charts.
3. Show real-time metrics (Active tickets, Pending, Response rate, Avg response time).
4. Add bar/line charts using Chart.js already included.
5. Add top agents leaderboard and recent tickets panel.
6. Apply same modern CSS framework as scheduler-modern.css.
7. Use Flex/Grid responsive layout, high contrast, soft shadows, and spacing consistency.
8. Ensure no loss of data and 100% backward compatibility.
